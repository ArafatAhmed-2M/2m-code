# 2M Code — The AI coding platform that thinks in teams

> **Multi-Mind:** Instead of one AI assistant, deploy a team of AI agents that plan, implement, and review code together — each from the best model for the job.

## What is 2M Code?

Every current AI coding tool gives you one model, one perspective, one brain. But real engineering teams work differently — they plan, implement, review, and iterate. A tech lead breaks down the problem. A senior engineer builds the solution. A QA engineer catches bugs before they ship. **2M Code brings this dynamic to AI.**

With 2M Code, you define a **team** of AI agents in a simple YAML file. Each agent has a name, a role, a provider (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, OpenAI-Compatible, Mistral, Cohere, Groq, Ollama, OpenRouter), and a system prompt that defines their personality and expertise. When you give the team a task, they collaborate through a shared conversation channel — each agent sees what the others have said, builds on their work, and contributes their unique perspective. The result? Code that has been planned, implemented, *and* reviewed before it reaches you.

**V2 adds** persistent memory across sessions, streaming token output, cost tracking with budgets, and custom tool definitions — making 2M Code production-ready for daily use.

## Installation

### Quick Install (macOS/Linux)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArafatAhmed-2M/2M-Code/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Install

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ArafatAhmed-2M/2M-Code.git 2mcode
cd 2mcode

# 2. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Build the Go binary
go build -o bin/2m ./cmd/2m

# 4. Add to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/bin"

# 5. Set up API keys (at least one provider)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY="your-key"   # DeepSeek, Together, xAI, etc.
export MISTRAL_API_KEY="your-key"
export COHERE_API_KEY="your-key"
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key"
# Ollama runs locally — no API key needed
# OpenAI-Compatible also needs: export OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL="https://api.deepseek.com"
```

### Requirements

- **Go 1.22+** — [Install Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
- **Python 3.11+** — [Install Python](https://python.org/downloads/)
- **API key** for at least one provider (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, OpenAI-Compatible, Mistral, Cohere, Groq, or OpenRouter). Ollama runs locally with no key needed.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a team

```bash
2m new-team
```

This launches an interactive wizard that walks you through creating a team — naming agents, assigning roles, choosing providers, and setting the workflow.

### 2. Run a task

```bash
2m run fullstack "Build a REST API for user authentication with JWT"
```

Watch your team collaborate in real time:

```
╭─ Aria · Tech Lead ────────────────────────
│ I'll break this into three subtasks:
│ 1. Database schema for users table
│ 2. Auth endpoints (register, login, refresh)
│ 3. JWT middleware for protected routes
╰──────────────────────────────────────────

╭─ Dev · Senior Engineer ───────────────────
│ Starting with the database schema...
│ ⚙ running bash: mkdir -p internal/auth
│ └ [created directory]
│ ...
╰──────────────────────────────────────────

╭─ Quinn · QA Engineer ────────────────────
│ Code Review Results:
│ ✓ Auth flow is solid
│ ⚠ Warning: Add rate limiting to login endpoint
│ ⚠ Warning: JWT secret should use env var, not hardcoded
╰──────────────────────────────────────────

✓ Team completed task in 4 turns · 3,241 tokens · 12.3s
```

### 3. Interactive chat

```bash
2m chat fullstack
```

Opens a REPL where you can have an ongoing conversation with your team.

## Team Configuration

Teams are defined in YAML. Here's a complete example with V2 features:

```yaml
name: fullstack
description: "A full-stack web development team"
version: "2.0"

agents:
  - name: Aria
    role: Tech Lead
    provider: anthropic          # Uses Claude
    model: claude-opus-4-5
    color: cyan
    max_context: 20              # Last 20 messages as context
    tools: [bash, read_file, write_file]
    system_prompt: |
      You are Aria, the Tech Lead. Break down tasks, set architecture
      direction, and coordinate the team...

  - name: Dev
    role: Senior Engineer
    provider: google             # Uses Gemini
    model: gemini-1.5-pro
    color: green
    tools: [bash, read_file, write_file]
    system_prompt: |
      You are Dev, the Senior Engineer. Implement features based on
      the tech lead's plan...

  - name: Quinn
    role: QA Engineer
    provider: openai             # Uses GPT-4o
    model: gpt-4o
    color: yellow
    tools: [bash, read_file]     # QA doesn't write files
    system_prompt: |
      You are Quinn, the QA Engineer. Review all code for bugs,
      security issues, and quality...

workflow:
  orchestration: leader_first    # Aria speaks first
  turns_per_task: 1              # One round of turns per task
  leader: Aria                   # Leader agent
  reviewer: Quinn                # Reviewer speaks last
  max_tokens_per_turn: 4096
  max_tokens_per_run: 32000      # Optional: overall budget for the run

# V2: Custom tools run arbitrary commands via bash
custom_tools:
  - name: lint_code
    description: "Run the project's linter on specified paths"
    command: "npm run lint -- {paths}"
    input_schema:
      type: object
      properties:
        paths:
          type: string
          description: "Space-separated file paths to lint"
      required: [paths]
```

Teams can be stored in:
- **Project-local:** `./.2mcode/teams/` — shared via version control
- **Global:** `~/.2mcode/teams/` — personal teams
- **Bundled:** `config/teams/` — example teams included with 2M Code

## How It Works

1. **Shared Team Channel.** All agent messages are stored in a SQLite database. Each agent reads the last N messages as context before responding — so they genuinely see each other's work, like a shared Slack channel.

2. **Turn-Based Orchestration.** Agents take turns in a defined order. In `leader_first` mode, the leader speaks first (usually the planner), then workers implement, then the reviewer gives final feedback.

3. **Streaming Output.** Agent responses stream token-by-token via SSE from the Python engine to the Go CLI, so you see text appear in real time — no waiting for the full response.

4. **Tool Access.** Agents can run bash commands, read files, and write files — just like you do when coding. The orchestrator handles tool execution and feeds results back to the agent. You can also define **custom tools** in the team YAML that run arbitrary commands via bash.

5. **Cost Tracking & Budgets.** Each run tracks input/output tokens and estimates cost. Set `max_tokens_per_run` in your workflow to enforce spending limits.

6. **Persistent Memory.** After each run, the orchestrator summarizes the session using `qwen/qwen3-coder:free` (1M+ context) via OpenRouter and saves it to `~/.2mcode/memory/`. Future runs inject relevant past context into agent prompts — so your team remembers decisions, code patterns, and user preferences across sessions.
